# Hopeful Winter
### A CSCI 3725 Project by Gerard Goucher

## Music Details

Hopeful Winter provides a sense of positivty and relaxation. It is calm in its slow pace, starting sequences an octave down and providing an upward musical trajectory, providing comfort to listeners. Occassionally, the piece increases its frequency even further, offering some suprise and musical diversity, while still providing the symmetry vital for relaxation. 

The song is best enjoyed with a cup of tea and a book, or in meditation. Feel free to experiment with the code on SonicPi.
